      <p class="description" style = "font-size: 1.25rem; text-align: justify;">
        GPBench is the first LLM medical evaluation framework for the work scenarios of general practitioners (GPs). 
        It realizes the systematic assessment of LLM’s general practice capabilities for the first time, and 
        provides a standardized paradigm for the evaluation of the practical application of medical AI in general practice. 
        GPBench is built around three core operational scenarios: clinical knowledge application, systematic analysis of medical records, 
        and dynamic outpatient interactions. Correspondingly, it comprises three specialized test sets: 
        the <b>MCQ Test Set</b>, the <b>Clinical Case Test Set</b>, and the <b>AI Patient Test Set</b>. All data were meticulously curated by experts from Tertiary A-grade hospital and
        constructed into high-precision ground truth based on clinical management standards. The data underwent rigorous fine-grained labeling, covering key competency indicators 
        to ensure the accuracy and clinical relevance of the evaluation results. Additionally, all data were strictly de-identified and reviewed for medical ethics compliance.
      </p>
      <p class="description" style = "font-size: 1.25rem; text-align: justify;">
        Our evaluation results indicate that LLMs exhibit common shortcomings in multiple competencies required for GPs, 
        reflecting underlying issues in their mechanisms, including <strong>hallucination</strong>, <strong>mechanistic modeling blindness</strong>, <strong>coarse granularity</strong>, and <strong>evidence-based practice insufficient</strong>.

          <strong>An overview of GPBench.</strong> For dataset construction, we compile multiple-choice questions
          from open-source datasets and real outpatient medical records from Tertiary A-grade hospitals to
          create three test sets: MCQ Test Set, Clinical Case Test Set, and AI Patient Test. Ground truth
          and scoring criteria for each case are annotated in details by experts. For evaluation, the GPBench
          framework innovatively employs the classic competency model of general practitioners to assess
          LLMs. Accuracy is used as the evaluation metric for the first test set, while for the other two test sets,
          experts grade responses based on the annotated scoring criteria.

          <p>
            General practitioners (GPs) serve as the cornerstone of primary healthcare systems
            by providing continuous and comprehensive medical services. However, due to
            community-oriented nature of their practice, uneven training and resource gaps,
            the clinical proficiency among GPs can vary significantly across regions and
            healthcare settings. Currently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
            great potential in clinical and medical applications, making them a promising
            tool for supporting general practice. However, most existing benchmarks and
            evaluation frameworks focus on exam-style assessments—typically multiple-choice
            question—lack comprehensive assessment sets that accurately mirror the real-
            world scenarios encountered by GPs. To evaluate how effectively LLMs can make
            decisions in the daily work of GPs, we designed GPBench, which consists of
            both test questions from clinical practice and a novel evaluation framework. The
            test set includes multiple-choice questions that assess fundamental knowledge of
            general practice, as well as realistic, scenario-based problems. All questions are
            meticulously annotated by experts, incorporating rich fine-grained information
            related to clinical management. The proposed LLM evaluation framework is
            based on the competency model for general practice, providing a comprehensive
            methodology for assessing LLM performance in real-world settings. As the first
            large-model evaluation set targeting GP decision-making scenarios, GPBench
            allows us to evaluate current mainstream LLMs. Expert assessment and evaluation
            reveal that in areas such as disease staging, complication recognition, treatment
            detail, and medication usage, these models exhibit at least ten major shortcomings.
            Overall, existing LLMs are not yet suitable for independent use in real-world GP
            working scenarios without human oversight.

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            In order to meet the need for evaluating large language models, we have drawn on classic general practitioner (GP) competency frameworks such as WONCA, ACGME, McClelland’s competency research dictionary, the Iceberg Model, and the Onion Model. Taking into account the actual working conditions of GPs in China, we propose a general practice competency model specifically for assessing large language models.

          <p style="text-align: justify;"> DeepSeek-R1, as a reasoning model, is not suitable for dialogue interaction scenarios.
            Because it could not meet the basic evaluation requirements, DeepSeek-R1 was excluded from the <strong>AI Patient Test Set</strong> results.

          <p>
            Significant deficiencies have been observed across multiple dimensions in the evaluation. Notably, the DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated superior performance in key capabilities such as diagnosis and treatment compared to other LLMs. However, it still shares common limitations with other models.
          </p>
          <h4 class="title is-4 has-text-justified">Diagnosis</h4>
          <p>LLMs generally exhibit several deficiencies in diagnosis, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Absence of grading and staging system</li>
            <li>Hallucinations on grading and staging</li>
            <li>Blind spots in complication recognition</li>
            <li>Deficiency in acute and severe condition assessment</li>
            <li>Lack of rare disease diagnosis</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="title is-4 has-text-justified">Treatment Decision-Making</h4>
          <p>  LLMs commonly struggle with: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lack of clear treatment goals</li>
            <li>Pharmacotherapy risks</li>
            <li>Blind spots in non-pharmacological interventions</li>
            <li>Insufficient standardization in critical illness management</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="title is-4 has-text-justified">Health Management</h4>
          <p>LLMs tend to provide overly generalized health education recommendations. While their outputs meet basic scoring criteria, they remain broad and lack actionable, specific guidance, making them insufficient for supporting real-world clinical practice.
          </p>

          <h4 class="title is-4 has-text-justified">Health Economics</h4>
          <p>Evaluations on the Clinical Case Test Set and AI Patient Test Set reveal that all LLMs fail to address treatment cost control and humanistic care, even when explicitly prompted. This suggests that current LLMs' understanding of primary healthcare remains at a simplified diagnostic and treatment level, lacking awareness of the broader social aspects of medical services.
          </p>

          <h4 class="title is-4 has-text-justified">Medical Ethics and Humanistic Care</h4>
          <p>All LLMs exhibit risks related to overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and misdiagnosis, indicating a need for further refinement in clinical decision-making.</p>

          <h4 class="title is-4 has-text-justified">Strengths and Limitations of DeepSeek-R1</h4>
          <p>Experts highlighted that among the ten evaluated models, DeepSeek-R1 performed relatively well in diagnosis and treatment:
  
            In diagnosis, it demonstrated more accurate staging and grading of diseases, and its diagnostic labels were more standardized and comprehensive than those of other LLMs.
            
            In treatment planning, DeepSeek-R1 adjusted strategies based on patient conditions and medication contraindications while emphasizing medication monitoring.
            
            This notable differentiation suggests directions for optimizing LLMs for general medical applications. However, DeepSeek-R1 still requires further improvements in instruction adherence, as evidenced by its performance in the AI Patient test set.
            </p>

            <div style="height: 30px;"></div>
            <p>Our study confirms that <strong>LLMs are not yet suitable for independent deployment in real-world general practice without human supervision.</strong>  While DeepSeek-R1 outperforms other models in key areas, it still shares common capability gaps with its peers.

            This model comprises six primary general practice competency indicators (basic medical knowledge, diagno- sis, decision-making, health management, health economics, and medical ethics and humanities) and sixteen secondary indicators (basic medical knowledge, diagnosis and differential diagnosis capability, medical his- tory taking proficiency, complication identification skill; acute and critical condition recognition, referral decision-making competence, formulation of optimal treatment plans, adverse drug reaction management, contraindications awareness, alternative therapy selection capacity, health education delivery expertise, tertiary prevention implementation, patient compliance improvement, family support provision ability, cost-effective care coordination, and humanistic care competency). Our model encompasses the primary competencies required in the daily work of general practitioners, which are also the capabilities expected of AI in the GP setting.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>MCQ Test Set.</strong> The test set consists of 3,661 multiple-choice questions (MCQ) and aims to evaluate the foundational medical knowledge and theoretical competency of LLMs in general practice, focusing on verifying the completeness of the model's knowledge system.</li>
            <li><strong>Clinical Case Test Set.</strong> Built on 70 real-world de-identified outpatient medical records, the test set adopts an open-ended analysis format, requiring LLMs to analyze complete outpatient cases and propose systematic diagnostic and treatment plans. It emphasizes the abilities of models to systematically analyze complex problems and identify blind spots within real-world clinical decision-making chains.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Patient Test Set.</strong> Based on the same 70 real-world de-identified outpatient medical records, the test set simulates real-world consultations by constructing AI-driven “patients” that dynamically interact with the LLM. It evaluates the clinical responsiveness and decision-making capabilities of LLMs in a simulated outpatient setting.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The <em>Clinical Case Test Set</em> and <em>AI Patient Test Set</em> are both built on 70 real-world de-identified outpatient medical records, covering eight major chronic diseases and ten common symptoms encountered in general practice. The reason we chose these diseases is that they have a relatively high consultation frequency in our survey targeting general practitioners. Moreover, CKD has a high prevalence in China and shows a clear upward trend. CVD is one of the leading causes of death in China, while CA ranks second among non-communicable chronic diseases in terms of mortality. Therefore, we selected samples from these eight diseases as evaluation cases. The reason we chose these ten symptoms is that they frequently appear in clinical consultations with general practitioners.</p>
          <p><strong>Metrics.</strong></p>
          <p>For the <em>MCQ Test Set</em>, we calculated the LLM’s accuracy in answering questions. To more precisely analyze the knowledge ability in terms of competence dimensions, we labeled each question with the corresponding competence indicator.</p>
          <p>For the <em>Clinical Case Test</em>, experienced clinical experts—based on actual work requirements—provide detailed correct answers, e.g., differential diagnosis, treatment, health education, and whether further examinations are needed. They also tag each part of the answer with its corresponding competence indicator. These answers can be directly used as clinical treatment of the corresponding patient. The experts then score the LLM’s output according to these labeled correct answers.</p>
          <p>For the <em>AI Patient Test Set</em>, experienced clinical experts score the diagnosis and treatment plans (including physical examinations and ancillary tests) generated by the LLMs after conversations with AI patients.</p>
